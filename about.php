        Who Rescued Who - Dog Rescue, sponsored by SPCA Animal Rescue and SAFE NZ aims to connect families with dogs in need of a home. It will work with various animal welfare organisations and private rescuers to find permanent homes for healthy and treatable, abandoned or unwanted dogs.<br>
        <br>
        Our aim is to bring together as many rescue groups and people nationwide as possible, making it easier for rescue groups to let people know about homeless dogs in their care. We hope that by collaborating with others, we can increase the profile of rescue pets and give them the best chance at being re-homed.<br>
        <br>
        Each year, tens of thousands of healthy and treatable dogs and puppies are abandoned around New Zealand and picked up by animal welfare organisations and shelters, and animal control. The high number of abandoned pets means that euthanasia occurs unless they can be re-homed.<br>
        <br>
        We hope that by collaborating on projects, we can increase the profile of rescue dogs and give these wonderful animals a second chance by acting as 'matchmakers' between these lovely canines and their new families.
