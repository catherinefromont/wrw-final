Journal for Final Assignment: 

Overall my website design and functionality did not change hugely from my original planning. 


Changes I made:

Navigation menu at top right hand side of website - changed to a dropdown (only when logged in) with only one menu item instead of three because of poor functionality when on mobile size screen. Poor usability having to navigation bars but I have made it work. All user features such as edit, add post, delete, comment etc work and is validated. 

I decided to only validate in JavaScript on my contact form, and only have basic PHP validation on my register/login pages. 

Dashboard/Edit pages both work, and are both connected to the database. Users can only add their own and edit their own posts, no one else's.

Those who have not registered or logged in can only view features although they can submit the contact form without being registered or logged in. They aren't able to comment, add new posts, edit/delete on any listings unless they are registered/logged in.

The search engine was a lot harder than I expected and a lot of the coding I needed help with. I got all the styling without any issues but when it came to functionality it was super difficult to understand what needed to happen. I did learn a lot doing this though. Users/non-Users are about to refine their search by location, gender, and age (instead of size). Danny and Ash did an amazing job helping me with this.

The Pagination didn't turn out the way I would have hoped in a design perspective but although it would of looked nicer to have the pagination that was in my planning, it would have been out of my knowledge to code. I managed to put in a user friendly basic pagination showing 8 listings per page, and using a special feature called "chunking" to align them nicely. 

A lot of my content ended up being left aligned which was different to my planning but I tested both and left aligning my content looked cleaner. 

My about, contact, register, login, edit and dashboard pages didn't differentiate at all from my planning for those pages as they were only going to be a basic user friendly template anyway. 

I will miss out on extra points for img upload because I didn't get around to putting that in. Unfortunately I have just got a basic img input grabbing the img address from another website so you cannot preview the img until it's been posted.

 On my view page the basic structure is the same, although the table of details about each dog is to the right of the upsized img, because that looked cleaner than having everything stacked underneath each other. 

 My site is responsive but there's a few small issues that I haven't been able to fix.

 My site is reasonably secure I probably could have done more to ensure it's completely safe from hacking but because this website isn't going live I decided not to worry too much. I know I will lose marks for this.
